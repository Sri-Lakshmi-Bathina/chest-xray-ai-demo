# 🫁 Chest X-Ray AI with Explainability (Grad-CAM + LLM)

🚨 **Educational Use Only — Not for Clinical Diagnosis**

This project demonstrates how a deep learning model analyzes chest X-ray images, highlights influential regions using **Grad-CAM**, and explains model behavior in **plain English**.  
It is designed as a **transparent, responsible AI demo** for medical imaging — **not** a diagnostic system.

## 🎯 Project Objective

Medical AI models are often criticized for being *black boxes*.  
This project focuses on **interpretability**, not accuracy bragging.

**Goals:**
- Show how a chest X-ray classification model arrives at predictions.
- Visualize *where* the model looks using Grad-CAM.
- Explain *why* predictions were made in simple, human-readable language.
- Demonstrate responsible AI deployment practices.

---

## 🧠 What This Project Does (End-to-End)

1. User uploads a chest X-ray image  
2. A pretrained deep learning model predicts probabilities for 18 thoracic findings  
3. Grad-CAM highlights image regions most influential for a selected prediction  
4. A language model explains the results in plain English  
5. Clear disclaimers ensure safe, non-clinical usage

## 🖼 Example Output

- Original X-ray image
- Grad-CAM heatmap overlay
- Multi-label probability table
- Human-readable explanation of model behavior

## 🔍 Explainability (Grad-CAM)

Grad-CAM (Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping):
- Computes gradients of a target class w.r.t. convolutional feature maps
- Produces a heatmap showing influential image regions
- Helps humans **understand model focus**, not confirm disease

> Important: Highlighted regions **do not indicate pathology** — only model attention.

---

## 🗣 Plain-English Explanation (LLM)

- If **Ollama (local LLM)** is available → explanation is generated locally
- If unavailable → safe, deterministic fallback explanation is used

This avoids:
- Cloud dependency
- Privacy risks
- Hallucinated medical advice
